Ballet is unique in the way it fosters both individual and collective growth in class. One of the most valuable aspects of ballet is that, regardless of class size, a skilled instructor will provide 1-on-1 corrections that benefit everyone. In ballet, even when a correction is made to one dancer, it’s really a lesson for all to absorb and apply. A good correction helps not just the individual, but the entire class move toward better technique and artistry.

At Somerset School of Ballet, we take this personal approach a step further. We intentionally cap our class sizes to ensure that each student receives even more focused, semi-private attention. By keeping classes small, our instructors have the opportunity to interact with every student, helping them refine their movements, adjust posture, or improve technique in a way that is tailored to their needs.

### **What Does a Small Class Size Mean for You?**

In a smaller class, students benefit from more personalized feedback and hands-on instruction. Here’s what that looks like at Somerset School of Ballet:

- **More Time for Individual Attention:** Every dancer gets the chance to be seen, understood, and guided by their instructor in a more intimate setting.
- **Faster Progress:** When a teacher has more time to address each student's strengths and areas for improvement, dancers can work on corrections faster and more effectively.
- **Supportive Learning Environment:** With fewer students, the classroom environment becomes more comfortable for asking questions and receiving corrections. Everyone benefits from the instructor’s close observation.
- **Enhanced Confidence:** Knowing that you’ll have dedicated time with your teacher helps build confidence, ensuring you’re developing not just as a dancer, but as an individual.

### **Semi-Private Lessons in Every Class**

At Somerset School of Ballet, we treat every class like a semi-private lesson. Our goal is to create a space where every dancer feels seen, valued, and supported in their personal ballet journey. Whether it’s your first time at the barre or you’re preparing for a performance, you’ll receive guidance that’s tailored to help you achieve your personal best.
