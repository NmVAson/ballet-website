When stepping into the ballet studio for the first time, one thing you'll quickly notice is how much time you spend looking at yourself in the mirror. This reflection is all part of honing your technique, so it's important to wear something that makes you feel both confident and at ease. For our drop-in classes, comfortable gym attire is perfectly fine, and you can even go barefoot!

If you're interested in building a more traditional ballet wardrobe, I recommend exploring options at [Discount Dance](https://www.discountdance.com/dancewear/). They offer a great selection of quality dancewear at reasonable prices.

### **Leotard**

A leotard, sometimes referred to as a "bodysuit," should fit snugly against your body to allow for free movement and proper alignment checks. Personally, I lean towards classic, simple designs without lace, as they tend to be more durable over time. Brands like Bloch, Capezio, and So Danca are reliable and offer a range of styles to suit every dancer.

One of my favorites is the [Classic Black with a Fun Back from So Danca](https://www.sodanca.com/collections/women-dancewear-leotards/products/annie-d379?variant=44510104256674) — it's elegant and adds a bit of flair!

### **Tights**

Convertible tights are my go-to choice. These tights have a small hole in the foot, allowing them to be easily rolled up for barefoot practice or tucked into street shoes for convenience. I prefer tights made from soft fabric rather than stiff mesh, as they are more comfortable, even if they're slightly more prone to tearing.

The pair I wear most often is the [Capezio Ultra Soft Transition Tight with Back Seam in Light Pink](https://www.capezio.com/ultra-soft-transition-tight-with-back-seam). They’re soft, comfortable, and perfect for class.

### **Shoes**

Ballet shoes are typically made from either leather or canvas. Many seasoned dancers, myself included, favor canvas split-soled shoes. They offer greater flexibility and adapt more naturally to the shape of your foot, enhancing your movement and comfort.

My top pick is the [Capezio Canvas Ballet Shoe](https://www.capezio.com/hanami-ballet-shoe). It's a reliable choice for both beginners and experienced dancers.

### **Pointe Shoes**

Pointe shoes are a unique part of ballet and require careful consideration. They are highly personalized to each dancer’s foot shape and strength, and as such, they should be professionally fitted. Dancers usually begin wearing pointe shoes around the age of 10, following an audition and a fitting by a pointe shoe specialist.

By choosing the right attire for your ballet class, you’ll not only feel more comfortable but also more confident, allowing you to focus fully on learning and enjoying the art of ballet. Happy dancing!
