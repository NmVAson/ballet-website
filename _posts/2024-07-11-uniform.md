When it comes to ballet, one thing you'll do a lot is stare at yourself in the mirror. So, first and foremost, wear whatever makes you feel confident and comfortable. When attending our drop-in classes, feel free to wear comfortable gym attire and go barefoot.

If you're looking to build a classic ballet wardrobe, I recommend checking out [Discount Dance](https://www.discountdance.com/dancewear/) for reliable, well-priced options.

### Leotard
The leotard, often called a "bodysuit," should fit snugly. Personally, I prefer classic designs without lace, as they tend to wear out quickly. Brands like Bloch, Capezio, and So Danca are my go-tos.

Here's one of my favorites: [Classic Black with A Fun Back from So Danca](https://www.sodanca.com/collections/women-dancewear-leotards/products/annie-d379?variant=44510104256674)

### Tights
Convertible tights are my preferenceâ€”they have a hole at the foot which can be rolled up for barefoot dancing or worn with street shoes outside of class. I opt for soft fabric over stiff mesh, as it's more comfortable, though likely to tear.

Here's what I wear: [Capezio Ultra Soft Transition Tight with Back Seam in Light Pink](https://www.capezio.com/ultra-soft-transition-tight-with-back-seam)

### Shoes
Ballet shoes are typically made from leather or canvas. Many experienced dancers, including myself, prefer canvas split-soled shoes for their flexibility.

Here's my choice: [Capezio Canvas Ballet Shoe](https://www.capezio.com/hanami-ballet-shoe)

### Pointe Shoes
Pointe shoes are highly individualized and require a professional fitting. Dancers typically begin wearing pointe shoes around age 10 after auditioning and being fitted by a specialist.
