# Representation in Ballet: Why It Matters

Ballet is an art form rooted in centuries of tradition, beauty, and discipline. However, for much of its history, ballet has not always reflected the diversity of the world around it. As we continue to move toward a more inclusive and equitable future, representation in ballet has become not only a goal but a necessity. Here’s why it matters:

## **Expanding the Narrative**

Every dancer brings their unique story, background, and perspective to the stage. By embracing diversity, ballet can expand its narrative and reflect the wide range of experiences and cultures that make up our global community. When audiences see themselves represented on stage, the art becomes more accessible and relatable.

## **Inspiring the Next Generation**

Representation matters most to those who dream. When young dancers see performers who look like them, they’re more likely to believe that they, too, can achieve their goals. Misty Copeland’s rise to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre inspired countless dancers of color to pursue their dreams despite historical barriers.

## **Challenging Traditional Norms**

For many years, ballet adhered to rigid aesthetic standards that excluded dancers based on their body type, skin color, or cultural background. Today, companies like Dance Theatre of Harlem and others are redefining what it means to be a ballerina by celebrating individuality and breaking outdated norms.

## **Fostering Creativity and Growth**

Diversity fosters creativity. When dancers from different backgrounds collaborate, they bring fresh ideas, styles, and techniques to the art form. This blending of influences not only enriches performances but also pushes the boundaries of what ballet can be.

## **Creating a Welcoming Community**

An inclusive ballet world is a welcoming one. Representation sends a powerful message that ballet is for everyone—regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, or ability. By opening its doors, the ballet community ensures its longevity and relevance in a changing world.

### Steps Toward Change

While progress has been made, there’s still work to be done. Here are some ways the ballet community can continue to foster representation:

- **Diversify leadership**: Representation starts at the top. Companies, schools, and organizations should prioritize hiring diverse leaders and educators.
- **Eliminate financial barriers**: Ballet training can be expensive. Scholarships and outreach programs can help make it more accessible to underrepresented communities.
- **Update repertoire and storytelling**: Introducing new ballets that reflect diverse stories and experiences allows the art to evolve and connect with modern audiences.
- **Provide support systems**: Mentorship programs and inclusive policies can ensure dancers feel supported and valued throughout their careers.

At Somerset School of Ballet, we believe that every dancer deserves the chance to shine. By fostering an inclusive environment and celebrating diversity, we hope to inspire a new generation of dancers who will carry ballet into a brighter, more inclusive future.
