As students progress in their ballet journey, many dream of dancing en pointe. However, before taking that step, it's essential to understand the difference between a regular ballet class and a preparation for pointe class. Pointe work demands a unique level of strength and technique, and the preparation class is a crucial step toward safely achieving that goal.

### **Regular Ballet Class: Building Foundations**

In a regular ballet class, dancers focus on developing the foundations of ballet technique. Through barre, center practice, and across-the-floor exercises, dancers improve:

- **Coordination and musicality**
- **Strength and flexibility**
- **Ballet vocabulary and technique**

These classes focus on core movements like pliés, tendus, jumps, and turns, aiming to create a well-rounded dancer. However, they do not specifically target the muscle groups needed for pointe work, making a separate preparation class essential for dancers aiming to go en pointe.

### **Preparation for Pointe Class: Strength for Pointe Work**

A preparation for pointe class is different from a regular ballet class because it is specifically designed to build the necessary strength, balance, and alignment needed for pointe work. In my pointe prep class, we focus on:

- **Foot and Ankle Strength**: Through theraband exercises, relevés, and foot articulation drills, we develop the strength needed to support the body en pointe.
- **Core Stability and Balance**: Exercises like planks, single-leg relevés, and balance drills improve core strength and stability, crucial for maintaining balance en pointe.
- **Alignment and Turnout**: We focus on proper turnout and body alignment to ensure safety and prevent injuries, with exercises that strengthen the hips, legs, and feet.
- **Flexibility**: Flexibility in the feet and Achilles tendons is important for smooth transitions onto pointe. In class, we perform focused stretches to improve range of motion.

Unlike regular ballet classes, the preparation for pointe class minimizes complex choreography and jumping, instead focusing on building the strength and control needed for pointe work.

### **Why Age Matters**

No student should begin pointe work before they are physically ready. I require students to be at least **13 years old** before going en pointe, and no dancer under **11 years old** should take a pointe prep class. This ensures that the bones and muscles have developed enough to safely handle the demands of pointe. The preparation class gives students the time they need to build strength, flexibility, and alignment, ensuring they are ready for the challenges of pointe work when the time comes.

### **Complementary to Regular Ballet Classes**

A preparation for pointe class works in tandem with regular ballet classes. The regular class helps dancers develop broad ballet technique, while the pointe prep class builds the specific strength and control needed for pointe. Together, they provide a comprehensive ballet education, preparing dancers to reach their goals safely and confidently.

By focusing on specific exercises designed to strengthen the body for pointe work, my preparation for pointe class will ensure that when the time comes, students are ready to take their next step in ballet—en pointe.
