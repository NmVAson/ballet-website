Whether you’re using this time to clean up choreography, work on entrances, or ask clarifying questions, here’s a guide to help you understand how to sign up, what to expect, and how to come prepared so you make the most of your session.</p> <hr> <h2 id="what-are-office-hours">What Are Office Hours?</h2> <p>Office Hours are short, bookable rehearsal slots where dancers can get personalized help during a set block of time. This is perfect for:</p> <ul> <li>Fine-tuning a tricky section of your piece.</li> <li>Getting feedback on a solo or duet.</li> <li>Clarifying stage directions, timing, or transitions.<br> Think of it like an “open tutoring session” for your ballet!</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="how-to-sign-up-for-office-hours">How to Sign Up for Office Hours:</h2> <ol> <li> <strong>Check the Weekly Schedule:</strong> Office Hours are held on <strong>Wednesdays from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm</strong>.</li> <li> <strong>Reserve Your Spot:</strong> Send me a message to reserve a <strong>15-minute slot</strong>. You can request a longer slot if available, but shorter sessions help me give everyone time.</li> <li> <strong>Confirmation:</strong> Once I confirm your slot, it’s yours! If you’re unable to make it, please let me know as soon as possible so I can offer the spot to another dancer.</li> </ol> <hr> <h2 id="what-to-expect-when-you-arrive">What to Expect When You Arrive:</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Shared Space:</strong> Sometimes, you may share the studio with another dancer who’s rehearsing nearby or waiting for their slot. Be mindful of your time and noise level so everyone gets the focus they need.</li> <li> <strong>Be a Supportive Audience:</strong> When you’re not warming up or reviewing for your timeslot, it’s customary to sit up front under the mirrors and act as a supportive audience for your peers. Encourage and cheer them on—it makes a big difference!</li> <li> <strong>Short and Focused:</strong> 15-minute slots fly by! This isn’t a full private rehearsal but rather a concentrated time to address one or two key points.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="how-to-come-prepared">How to Come Prepared:</h2> <p>To make the most of your time, come with a clear <strong>intention</strong> for your session. Here are a few examples of what a productive session might focus on:</p> <ul> <li>“I need help smoothing out my arm transitions in the final combination.”</li> <li>“Can we review my stage entrance for counts 5–8?”</li> <li>“I want to make sure my pirouette sequence is clean and controlled.”</li> </ul> <p>This gives me a clear idea of where to direct our time so we can dive right in and get as much done as possible.</p> <hr> <h2 id="tips-for-making-the-most-of-office-hours">Tips for Making the Most of Office Hours:</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Warm Up Beforehand:</strong> Come stretched and warmed up so you’re ready to go as soon as your slot begins.</li> <li> <strong>Bring Notes:</strong> If you’ve written down any questions or corrections, bring them so we can reference them easily.</li> <li> <strong>Be Open to Feedback:</strong> Sometimes fixing one section will reveal new areas to focus on. Use the feedback you get to apply corrections across the rest of your choreography.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="why-office-hours-are-here-for-you">Why Office Hours Are Here for You:</h2> <p>These rehearsal slots are designed to support you as you prepare for the show, without requiring a big time or financial commitment.
