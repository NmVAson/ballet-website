While they share some similarities, these two types of classes offer distinct experiences. Whether you’re working toward fitness goals or honing your dance technique, understanding the differences between barre and ballet will help you make the right choice for your needs.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-barre-class"><strong>What is a Barre Class?</strong></h3> <p>Barre classes take inspiration from ballet movements and techniques but combine them with elements of Pilates, yoga, and strength training. These classes use the ballet barre as a tool to help improve balance, flexibility, and strength. The focus is often on small, controlled movements and repetitions designed to tone major muscle groups—particularly in the legs, core, and glutes—similar to a standard fitness class.</p> <p>Barre is a great choice if you’re looking for a low-impact, full-body workout that focuses on sculpting muscles without the need for extensive choreography or prior dance experience. It’s accessible to all fitness levels and offers a welcoming environment for anyone seeking to improve their fitness in a graceful way.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-ballet-class"><strong>What is a Ballet Class?</strong></h3> <p>A ballet class, on the other hand, centers on classical dance training. It emphasizes technique, posture, coordination, and flexibility while also fostering artistic expression. Students learn traditional positions and movements like pliés, tendus, and pirouettes, developing a strong foundation in dance that can be built upon over time.</p> <p>One key difference is that ballet focuses on activating and strengthening smaller, often overlooked muscle groups—like those in your feet, ankles, and neck—that are not typically targeted in other fitness routines. These minor muscles help support balance, precision, and the fluidity of movement unique to ballet.</p> <p>Ballet classes are ideal if you’re interested in learning the art of dance, developing long-term technique, or even preparing for performances. While ballet certainly strengthens and tones the body, its primary focus is on learning dance vocabulary and improving skills over time. Ballet is often progressive, meaning that students advance in levels as they master specific techniques.</p> <h3 id="which-should-you-choose"><strong>Which Should You Choose?</strong></h3> <p>The choice between a barre class and a ballet class depends on your personal goals:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choose a Barre Class if:</strong></p> <ul> <li>You’re seeking a fitness-focused workout.</li> <li>You want to tone and strengthen major muscle groups like legs, glutes, and core.</li> <li>You’re looking for low-impact exercise that incorporates elements of dance.</li> <li>You’re new to fitness and want a welcoming, non-intimidating environment.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choose a Ballet Class if:</strong></p> <ul> <li>You’re passionate about learning dance technique.</li> <li>You want to develop posture, balance, and grace by working both major and minor muscle groups.</li> <li>You’re interested in progressing through levels of ballet or even performing.</li> <li>You’re looking for both mental and physical challenges, as ballet combines artistry with technique.</li> <li>Six-year-old you always wanted to take a ballet class, but your parents signed you up for soccer instead 😉</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="complementary-practices"><strong>Complementary Practices</strong></h3> <p>It’s worth noting that ballet and barre don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Many dancers use barre classes as a form of cross-training to strengthen muscles that support their dance practice. Likewise, those who fall in love with the grace and precision of barre might find themselves inspired to dive deeper into the art of ballet.</p> <p>Both barre and ballet have incredible benefits, and the best part is that you can enjoy either (or both!) depending on where you are in your fitness or dance journey.</p>]]></content><author><name>Giuliana Taylor</name></author><category term="ballet,"/><category term="barre,"/><category term="fitness,"/><category term="dance"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn the key differences between barre and ballet classes, and when each is the right choice for your fitness or dance journey.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why We Cap Class Sizes at Somerset School of Ballet</title><link href="https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/class-size/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why We Cap Class Sizes at Somerset School of Ballet"/><published>2024-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-14T14:09:12+00:00</updated><id>https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/class-size</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/class-size/"><![CDATA[<p>Ballet is unique in the way it fosters both individual and collective growth in class. One of the most valuable aspects of ballet is that, regardless of class size, a skilled instructor will provide 1-on-1 corrections that benefit everyone. In ballet, even when a correction is made to one dancer, it’s really a lesson for all to absorb and apply. A good correction helps not just the individual, but the entire class move toward better technique and artistry.</p> <p>At Somerset School of Ballet, we take this personal approach a step further. We intentionally cap our class sizes to ensure that each student receives even more focused, semi-private attention. By keeping classes small, our instructors have the opportunity to interact with every student, helping them refine their movements, adjust posture, or improve technique in a way that is tailored to their needs.</p> <h3 id="what-does-a-small-class-size-mean-for-you"><strong>What Does a Small Class Size Mean for You?</strong></h3> <p>In a smaller class, students benefit from more personalized feedback and hands-on instruction. Here’s what that looks like at Somerset School of Ballet:</p> <ul> <li><strong>More Time for Individual Attention:</strong> Every dancer gets the chance to be seen, understood, and guided by their instructor in a more intimate setting.</li> <li><strong>Faster Progress:</strong> When a teacher has more time to address each student’s strengths and areas for improvement, dancers can work on corrections faster and more effectively.</li> <li><strong>Supportive Learning Environment:</strong> With fewer students, the classroom environment becomes more comfortable for asking questions and receiving corrections. Everyone benefits from the instructor’s close observation.</li> <li><strong>Enhanced Confidence:</strong> Knowing that you’ll have dedicated time with your teacher helps build confidence, ensuring you’re developing not just as a dancer, but as an individual.</li> </ul> <h3 id="semi-private-lessons-in-every-class"><strong>Semi-Private Lessons in Every Class</strong></h3> <p>At Somerset School of Ballet, we treat every class like a semi-private lesson. Our goal is to create a space where every dancer feels seen, valued, and supported in their personal ballet journey. Whether it’s your first time at the barre or you’re preparing for a performance, you’ll receive guidance that’s tailored to help you achieve your personal best.</p>]]></content><author><name>Giuliana Taylor</name></author><category term="class-size,"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover how Somerset School of Ballet provides personalized instruction by capping class sizes for a semi-private experience.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Transparency in Dance: Understanding the True Cost of a Ballet Performance</title><link href="https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/performance-costs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Transparency in Dance: Understanding the True Cost of a Ballet Performance"/><published>2024-09-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-14T14:09:12+00:00</updated><id>https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/performance-costs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/performance-costs/"><![CDATA[<p>When enrolling your child in dance, it’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of recitals and performances.

While much emphasis is often placed on the positions of the feet, the positions of the arms are equally vital in creating the elegant lines that ballet is known for. For beginners, mastering these basic arm positions is a fundamental step toward developing a strong ballet foundation. Let’s explore the five primary positions of the arms in ballet and how they contribute to your technique and artistry.</p> <h3 id="1-first-position-première-position"><strong>1. First Position (Première Position)</strong></h3> <p>In the first position, the arms form a soft, rounded shape in front of the body, just above the waist. Imagine holding a beach ball lightly with your fingertips almost touching. Your shoulders should remain down and relaxed, and your elbows lifted to create a gentle curve. This position helps dancers build awareness of their arm placement and core engagement.</p> <h3 id="2-second-position-seconde-position"><strong>2. Second Position (Seconde Position)</strong></h3> <p>From first position, the arms open outward to the sides, maintaining a gentle curve. The palms face forward, and the elbows remain slightly bent to avoid hyperextension. In second position, dancers learn to expand their reach while maintaining a graceful line, which is essential for balance and poise in dance.</p> <h3 id="3-third-position-troisième-position"><strong>3. Third Position (Troisième Position)</strong></h3> <p>In third position, one arm remains in first position in front of the body, while the other arm extends to second position. This position is less commonly used in modern ballet but is a great exercise for beginners to practice coordination and control. It prepares dancers for more complex arm movements and transitions.</p> <h3 id="4-fourth-position-quatrième-position"><strong>4. Fourth Position (Quatrième Position)</strong></h3> <p>Fourth position involves one arm in a high position above the head and the other in first position in front of the body. The arm above the head should be slightly curved, with the palm facing downward, and the shoulders remain relaxed. This position requires strong core support and helps dancers practice the alignment and balance necessary for more advanced movements.</p> <h3 id="5-fifth-position-cinquième-position"><strong>5. Fifth Position (Cinquième Position)</strong></h3> <p>In fifth position, both arms are raised above the head, forming a rounded oval shape. The fingertips are almost touching, and the palms face inward. This is one of the most iconic and elegant positions in ballet, often used in various movements and poses. Fifth position of the arms, combined with other positions of the feet, creates a complete and harmonious line in ballet.</p> <h3 id="tips-for-beginners"><strong>Tips for Beginners:</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Keep Your Shoulders Down:</strong> Always ensure your shoulders are relaxed and down, even when your arms are raised. This prevents tension and helps maintain a long, graceful neck line.</li> <li><strong>Use Your Back Muscles:</strong> Engage your back muscles to support your arms. This will help prevent fatigue and maintain a beautiful line.</li> <li><strong>Practice in Front of a Mirror:</strong> Use a mirror to check your arm positions and alignment. This visual feedback is crucial for self-correction and improvement.</li> <li><strong>Stay Soft and Graceful:</strong> While maintaining the form and structure of each position, remember to keep your arms soft and graceful, avoiding stiffness or rigidity.</li> </ul> <p>By mastering these basic arm positions, you are building a strong foundation that will support you in every step of your ballet journey. Remember, practice and patience are key. With time, these positions will become second nature, allowing you to focus more on expression and artistry in your dancing.

Each exercise at the barre is carefully sequenced to warm up the body, build strength, and develop technique. Understanding the order of these exercises is key to getting the most out of your ballet training. Let’s take a closer look at the typical progression of barre exercises and why they are structured in this particular order.</p> <h3 id="1-pliés"><strong>1. Pliés</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Pliés, meaning “to bend,” are the cornerstone of ballet technique. This exercise is performed in all five positions of the feet and helps to warm up the legs, knees, ankles, and feet. It also promotes proper posture and alignment.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Pliés start with demi-pliés (half-bends) and then move to grand pliés (deep bends), focusing on maintaining turnout and core engagement. They teach dancers to move fluidly while keeping their upper bodies steady.</p> <h3 id="2-tendus"><strong>2. Tendus</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tendus, meaning “to stretch,” are performed by sliding the foot along the floor to a pointed position. This exercise helps strengthen the feet and legs while developing the articulation of the foot and the precision of movement.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Tendus are usually performed in all directions: devant (front), à la seconde (side), and derrière (back). The focus is on brushing the floor with the toes and maintaining a strong, stretched leg.</p> <h3 id="3-dégagés"><strong>3. Dégagés</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Dégagés, or “disengages,” are similar to tendus but with the foot lifted slightly off the floor. This exercise builds speed, sharpness, and control, which are essential for more advanced movements like jumps and turns.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Dégagés are executed briskly to help strengthen the dancer’s instep and improve dynamic control. They are often performed in quick succession, emphasizing sharp, precise movements.</p> <h3 id="4-rond-de-jambe"><strong>4. Rond de Jambe</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Rond de jambe, meaning “circle of the leg,” involves tracing a circular pattern with the working leg while keeping the supporting leg steady. This exercise improves hip mobility and teaches coordination and fluidity in movement.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Rond de jambe can be performed à terre (on the ground) or en l’air (in the air). The circular motion helps to loosen the hip joints and develop a range of motion, which is crucial for grand battements and adagio movements.</p> <h3 id="5-frappés"><strong>5. Frappés</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Frappés, meaning “to strike,” are sharp, striking movements of the foot against the floor. This exercise helps develop strength and precision in the feet and lower legs, crucial for jumps and quick footwork.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> The foot starts flexed at the ankle and quickly extends to a fully pointed position. Frappés train the dancer to engage the muscles quickly and prepare for fast, sharp movements.</p> <h3 id="6-fondues"><strong>6. Fondues</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Fondues, meaning “to melt,” are performed by bending both the working and supporting legs simultaneously and then extending them. This exercise emphasizes balance, control, and smooth transitions between movements.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Fondues are often performed slowly to develop strength and stability in the supporting leg while promoting graceful movements in the working leg. They are vital for developing the coordination needed for jumps and turns.</p> <h3 id="7-adagio"><strong>7. Adagio</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Adagio exercises are slow, controlled movements that focus on balance, extension, and fluidity. These exercises develop a dancer’s ability to sustain positions and move gracefully through space.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Adagio typically includes a combination of développés (unfolding the leg), arabesques, and other sustained positions. The slow pace challenges a dancer’s control, balance, and strength.</p> <h3 id="8-grand-battements"><strong>8. Grand Battements</strong></h3> <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Grand battements, meaning “large beats,” are powerful kicks of the working leg into the air while keeping the supporting leg straight. This exercise helps to increase flexibility, strength, and power in the legs.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> Grand battements are performed to the front, side, and back, emphasizing height and control. They prepare the dancer for jumps and other dynamic movements by building strength and flexibility.</p> <h3 id="why-is-the-order-important"><strong>Why is the Order Important?</strong></h3> <p>The order of barre exercises is designed to systematically warm up and prepare the dancer’s body for more complex movements. Each exercise builds upon the skills and muscle groups targeted by the previous one, creating a logical progression that ensures the dancer’s body is fully prepared for center work and across-the-floor exercises. By following this sequence, dancers can develop proper technique, prevent injuries, and achieve a well-rounded ballet education.</p> <h3 id="tips-for-mastering-barre-work"><strong>Tips for Mastering Barre Work:</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Focus on Alignment:</strong> Always keep your body properly aligned and engage your core muscles to maintain stability.</li> <li><strong>Use the Mirror:</strong> Check your positions and movements in the mirror to ensure you’re executing each exercise correctly.</li> <li><strong>Breathe:</strong> Remember to breathe naturally throughout each exercise, as this helps with control and prevents tension.</li> <li><strong>Listen to Corrections:</strong> Pay close attention to your instructor’s corrections and feedback to improve your technique.</li> <li><strong>Practice Consistently:</strong> Regular practice is key to mastering barre exercises and advancing in ballet.</li> </ul> <p>By understanding the order and purpose of each barre exercise, you can approach your ballet training with greater focus and intention. Embrace the barre as a vital part of your ballet journey, and enjoy the process of growing stronger, more flexible, and more skilled with each class!</p> <hr/> <p>This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of the order of barre exercises, explaining their purpose and benefits while offering practical tips to help students improve their technique and confidence in ballet.</p>]]></content><author><name>Giuliana Taylor</name></author><category term="technique"/><category term="vocab"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn the sequence of barre exercises in ballet and their importance in developing technique and strength.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mastering the Basics: Understanding the Positions of the Feet in Ballet</title><link href="https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/feet/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mastering the Basics: Understanding the Positions of the Feet in Ballet"/><published>2024-07-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-14T14:09:12+00:00</updated><id>https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/feet</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://somersetballet.com/blog/2024/feet/"><![CDATA[<figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FootPositions-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FootPositions-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FootPositions-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/FootPositions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h3 id="ballet-positions-of-the-feet">Ballet Positions of the Feet</h3> <p>These positions form the foundation of ballet technique and are essential for proper alignment, balance, and movement.</p> <p>Here are some of my notes, as an instructor:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>First Position</strong></p> <ul> <li>Heels together with toes turned out, forming a straight line.</li> <li>Legs are rotated outward from the hips.</li> <li>Lift your arches</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Second Position</strong></p> <ul> <li>Feet are turned out and placed about hip-width apart.</li> <li>Heels remain on the same line as in first position.</li> <li>Lift your arches</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Third Position</strong></p> <ul> <li>One foot is placed in front of the other, with the heel of the front foot touching the arch of the back foot.</li> <li>Both feet are turned outwards.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fourth Position</strong></p> <ul> <li>One foot is placed in front of the other, about one foot’s length apart.</li> <li>Both feet are turned outwards, with the heel of the front foot aligned with the toes of the back foot.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fifth Position</strong></p> <ul> <li>One foot is placed in front of the other, with the heel of the front foot touching the toes of the back foot.</li> <li>Both feet are turned outwards, forming two parallel lines.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sixth Position (Parallel)</strong></p> <ul> <li>Feet are parallel to each other, typically about hip-width apart.</li> <li>Toes are pointing forward, not turned out.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>To check your <em>natural</em> turnout, bend your knees in any position and make sure your knee aligns with your toe.

This reflection is all part of honing your technique, so it’s important to wear something that makes you feel both confident and at ease. For our drop-in classes, comfortable gym attire is perfectly fine, and you can even go barefoot!</p> <p>If you’re interested in building a more traditional ballet wardrobe, I recommend exploring options at <a href="https://www.discountdance.com/dancewear/">Discount Dance</a>. They offer a great selection of quality dancewear at reasonable prices.</p> <h3 id="leotard"><strong>Leotard</strong></h3> <p>A leotard, sometimes referred to as a “bodysuit,” should fit snugly against your body to allow for free movement and proper alignment checks. Personally, I lean towards classic, simple designs without lace, as they tend to be more durable over time. Brands like Bloch, Capezio, and So Danca are reliable and offer a range of styles to suit every dancer.</p> <p>One of my favorites is the <a href="https://www.sodanca.com/collections/women-dancewear-leotards/products/annie-d379?variant=44510104256674">Classic Black with a Fun Back from So Danca</a> — it’s elegant and adds a bit of flair!</p> <h3 id="tights"><strong>Tights</strong></h3> <p>Convertible tights are my go-to choice. These tights have a small hole in the foot, allowing them to be easily rolled up for barefoot practice or tucked into street shoes for convenience. I prefer tights made from soft fabric rather than stiff mesh, as they are more comfortable, even if they’re slightly more prone to tearing.</p> <p>The pair I wear most often is the <a href="https://www.capezio.com/ultra-soft-transition-tight-with-back-seam">Capezio Ultra Soft Transition Tight with Back Seam in Light Pink</a>. They’re soft, comfortable, and perfect for class.</p> <h3 id="shoes"><strong>Shoes</strong></h3> <p>Ballet shoes are typically made from either leather or canvas. Many seasoned dancers, myself included, favor canvas split-soled shoes. They offer greater flexibility and adapt more naturally to the shape of your foot, enhancing your movement and comfort.</p> <p>My top pick is the <a href="https://www.capezio.com/hanami-ballet-shoe">Capezio Canvas Ballet Shoe</a>. It’s a reliable choice for both beginners and experienced dancers.</p> <h3 id="pointe-shoes"><strong>Pointe Shoes</strong></h3> <p>Pointe shoes are a unique part of ballet and require careful consideration. They are highly personalized to each dancer’s foot shape and strength, and as such, they should be professionally fitted. Dancers usually begin wearing pointe shoes around the age of 10, following an audition and a fitting by a pointe shoe specialist.</p> <p>By choosing the right attire for your ballet class, you’ll not only feel more comfortable but also more confident, allowing you to focus fully on learning and enjoying the art of ballet.
